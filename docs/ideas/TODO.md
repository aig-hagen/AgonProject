## Features

### use tags to filter AF types
Tags are now defined and associated with each module (see `src/modules/common/tags.ts` and each module's `moduleConfig.ts`). In the future, those can be used to filter AF types; can also implement a search bar on the main page.


### Split Basic Tutorials into functional part and argumentation part
There should be a short tutorial, just for the controls, and one more detailed tutorial that explains in more detail the specifics of the argumentation formalism.

### Qualified Reasoners
Make available all (Semi-)Qualified Reasoners in the interface

## New Framework Types

### Extended AFs
- need to implement extended edges in graph-component
- extended attacks stored separately
- distinguish between extended and recursive-extended AFs?
- need TweetyProject endpoint
- take a look at the TweetyProject reasoner (performance)

### Weighted AFs
- How to incorporate the Semiring? Select in EvalWindow?
- alpha/beta parameters need to be setable in the EvalWindow as well
- need TweetyProject endpoint
- reconsider TweetyProject reasoners; can we extend that easily to have more semantics available? no
